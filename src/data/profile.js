  bio: `
    <p>I am a research-driven machine learning engineer with nearly a decade of hands-on experience spanning deep learning, reinforcement learning, conversational and agentic AI, and large-scale production systems. My career bridges the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world deployment: from pioneering training and fine-tuning methods for transformer and agent-based models, to architecting end-to-end workflows that empower autonomous AI agents across complex domains.</p>
    
    <p>I excel at designing scalable model training strategies (especially LLM), deploying robust ML systems in enterprise environments, and building agentic AI that orchestrates tools, data-flows, and conversational interfaces. With a strong foundation in software engineering, MLOps, and infrastructure, I lead projects from prototype to productionâ€”delivering enterprise-grade AI that fuels innovation.</p>
    
    <p>Passionate about the frontier of AI, I thrive on verifying and implementing research outcomes, mentoring teams to level up their capabilities, and creating systems that combine algorithmic advances with seamless integration into real business workflows.</p>
