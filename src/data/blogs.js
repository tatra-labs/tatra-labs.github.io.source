      <h2>Why Minimal Design Works</h2>
      <p>Minimal design is not about removing features or functionality. It's about removing distractions and focusing on what truly matters.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Principles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>White space is your friend</li>
        <li>Typography matters more than you think</li>
        <li>Every element should have a purpose</li>
        <li>Consistency creates familiarity</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Real World Applications</h3>
      <p>Some of the most successful products in the world embrace minimal design. Apple, Google, and many other tech giants have proven that simplicity scales.</p>
      
      <p>The challenge is knowing what to keep and what to remove. That's where the art comes in.</p>

      <h2>Planning for Scale</h2>
      <p>Scalability isn't just about handling more users. It's about maintaining code quality, team productivity, and system reliability as your application grows.</p>
      
      <h3>Architecture Patterns</h3>
      <p>Choosing the right architecture is crucial. Whether it's microservices, monoliths, or something in between, each approach has its trade-offs.</p>
      
      <h3>Code Organization</h3>
      <p>A well-organized codebase is easier to maintain and scale. Component-based architecture, clear separation of concerns, and consistent naming conventions all contribute to scalability.</p>
      
      <h3>Performance Considerations</h3>
      <p>Performance is a feature. Lazy loading, code splitting, and efficient state management are essential for applications that need to scale.</p>

      <h2>Modern Layout Techniques</h2>
      <p>CSS Grid and Flexbox have revolutionized how we approach layout in web development. Gone are the days of float-based layouts and hacky solutions.</p>
      
      <h3>When to Use Grid</h3>
      <p>Grid is perfect for two-dimensional layouts. When you need to control both rows and columns, Grid is your best friend.</p>
      
      <h3>When to Use Flexbox</h3>
      <p>Flexbox excels at one-dimensional layouts. It's perfect for navigation bars, card layouts, and centering elements.</p>
      
      <h3>Combining Both</h3>
      <p>The real power comes from combining both techniques. Use Grid for the overall page layout and Flexbox for component-level layouts.</p>

      <h2>JavaScript's Evolution</h2>
      <p>JavaScript continues to evolve at a rapid pace. New features and proposals are constantly being added to make the language more powerful and developer-friendly.</p>
      
      <h3>Upcoming Features</h3>
      <p>Features like the pipeline operator, pattern matching, and temporal API are set to change how we write JavaScript.</p>
      
      <h3>TypeScript's Influence</h3>
      <p>TypeScript has shown that type safety is valuable. Many of its concepts are influencing the direction of JavaScript itself.</p>
      
      <h3>What This Means for Developers</h3>
      <p>Staying current with JavaScript means continuous learning. But it also means having access to better tools and patterns for building applications.</p>
